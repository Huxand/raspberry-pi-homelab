# Pi-hole DNS Sinkhole + Docker-Powered Homelab on Raspberry Pi 5

This project documents the setup and deployment of a network-wide DNS sinkhole using **Pi-hole** running in a **Docker container** on a **Raspberry Pi 5**. It is part of my ongoing cybersecurity homelab initiative to strengthen skills in network monitoring, DNS filtering, containerization, and system administration.

---

##  Project Goals

- Deploy a low-cost, low-power DNS filtering server using Pi-hole
- 24/7 Run services in isolated Docker containers for modularity and control
- Configure a secure homelab network for hands-on cybersecurity practice
- Document and showcase practical experience for recruiters
